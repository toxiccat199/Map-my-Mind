    <h1>MAP MY MIND GUIDE</h1>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to the Map my Mind Guide! This should hopefully give the simple steps to making some great
        mindmaps fast! Let's get right into it.</p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>

        About me</p>

    <h2>Basic Website</h2>
    <p>The Website is split into 4 parts:
        The viewport. The biggest section and is your mindmap.<br>
        Insert area. allows you to create nodes (text) and other stuff.<br>
        Edit Menu. allows you to, well, edit nodes.<br>
        top bar. Other small features, how you came to this guide!<br><br>

        Tap on the node button in the insert menu to make a node. It should appear in the middle of the screen. You can
        drag it around to move it (You can also drag the viewport around!). or double click on it to edit the text. When
        you make a node, it is connected to the object you have selected. Tap once on a node to select it.
        <br><br>
        Now, we can make a fairly nice mindmap, but it is still pretty boring, so let's add some cool stuff! You can
        click the notes button in the insert menu to add extra text below it. You can also press the info button to add
        a small box above. keep in mind that info can only hold up to 4 characters, so use it to hold things like ‘1’
        and ‘fact’. You can remove them by pressing their respectful buttons again.
        <br><br>
        The last thing you can insert is a list. A list is a special node that is shaped like a rectangle. It also has a
        title, allowing you to label it. lists cannot have notes or infos. That's pretty much it.
        <br><br>
        Finally, once you have finished your mindmap, go to the top bar, press file and save. It will save as a Json
        file. There is no autosave, so make sure you save leaving the website!
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>Smaller Features</h2>
    <p>This next section will explain every other small features of the website, more specifically the properties and
        the top bar, so let's begin!
        <br><br>
        The property menu allows you to edit the selected object. Here are all of the cool stuff you can change!
        <br><br>
        Node:<br>
        Is Connected: hides/shows the nodes line<br>
        Has Bubble: hides/shows the bubble.and the background. Keep in mind that if the node has no text, the bubble
        will be slightly visible.<br>
        Text Colour: Self Explanatory. changes EVERY nodes text colour.<br>
        Bubble Colour: Same as the last.<br>
        Size: changes the size…<br>
        List:<br>
        Is Connected: Same as Node<br>
        Text Colour: Same as Node<br>
        Outline Colour: Changes the outline colour<br>
        Title Type: If the title is at the top,bottom or there is none.<br>
        <br><br>
        Yep, that's it. Let's now go to the topbar.
        <br><br>
        File:<br>
        New: Resets the mindmap<br>
        Open: Open up a saved mindmap<br>
        Save as: Save a mindmap<br>
        Edit:<br>
        Restore default colours: Resets the colours to the default. Useful if you dont like the colours you like or you
        break dark mode.<br>
        <!-- auto bubble parent: When on, makes any new nodes not have a bubble until you add a node to it.<br> -->
        Insert sibling node/list: Makes a node/list, that it and the selected node is connected to the same node.<br>
        Insert bulletpoint: Inserts, well, a bulletpoint.<br>
        View:<br>
        Zoom in/out: Zooms in, Zooms out.<br>
        Zoom fit: Fits the mindmap onto the screen (note: buggy).<br>
        Reset Zoom: Resets the zoom back to the original.<br>
        Change Theme; Makes the website dark and cozy.<br>
        Don't Click This: There is no reason for you to click this.<br>
        Hide UI: Hide everything but the viewport. Press Alt+H to undo.<br>
        <h2 id="blocked">Blocked opening/saving</h2>
        <p>
Sadly, some organisations don’t like the save/open functionality (neither does firefox) so we need an alternative! When saving, you will just be given the mindmap as text! Copy this into a google doc or something, or even an old mindmap file!<br><br>
Opening is a bit more tricky. You need to paste it in this time. If you are pasting it in as text, just paste it in! If you are opening a json file, copy the contents of the text. IMPORTANT: Even if you open something not a mindmap, your current one will be cleared.<br>

    <h2 id="aboutMe">About me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Cillian! I'm a coder and ui designer. I hope you like this website, as it was one of my
        favourite projects ever! I started my coding journey on Roblox, making a couple of, not so good games, like Obby
        of Ease. This streak ended when I made a bingo game called, well, Bingo. It was incredibly fun and encourage me to try bigger projects.
        A few months later, I started this website. Although it does have a couple of bugs, I am
        still very proud of it. Hope you enjoy!</p>
